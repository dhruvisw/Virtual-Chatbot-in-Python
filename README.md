# Virtual-Chatbot-in-Python

ü§ñA chatbot (derived from ‚Äúchat robot‚Äù) is a computer program that simulates human conversation, either via voice or text communication. 
There are a number of synonyms for chatbot, including "talkbot," "bot," "IM bot".

Chatbot is an automated program that interacts with customers like a human would and cost little to nothing to engage with.With chatbots, people can have a conversation with a person (a sales rep or a support agent, for instance), or interact with a software program that helps them find answers quickly. 
 
Chatbots attend to customers at all times of the day and week and are not limited by time or a physical location
Key examples are chatbots used by businesses in Facebook messenger, or as virtual assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa.

üéØIn this project we have created a chatbot in Python that accepts certain voice commands and executes them accordingly.
